# Rumble

**Friendly bets. Real actions. No money.**

Rumble is a social prediction app that lets friends settle everyday arguments using fun, non-monetary stakes. Instead of betting cash, users wager real-life actions like chores, favors, or dares. It turns small disagreements into playful accountability.

## Why Rumble Exists

Every friend group has those moments:

- “Who’s going to skip class first?”
- “Who will be late tonight?”
- “Who’s winning the game?”

These little debates usually end in forgotten bets and unresolved promises.  
Rumble was built to change that.

With Rumble, arguments become structured challenges, losers follow through, and everyone gets a good story out of it.

## Identity at the Core

Rumble is more than a betting app – it’s an identity app.

Instead of defining people through static profiles, Rumble defines identity through behavior:

- How confidently you make predictions  
- How reliably you complete stakes  
- How often you start challenges  
- How your habits evolve over time  

Using AI-powered analysis, Rumble builds a dynamic identity profile for each user across four pillars:

- **Express** – boldness and confidence  
- **Protect** – caution and careful choices  
- **Create** – initiative and leadership  
- **Evolve & Change** – growth over time  

These insights become fun **Identity Badges** that grow with you as you use the app.
